# AI-Agent-for-Healthcare-Outreach
Heritage Health Network (HHN) operates under California’s CalAIM initiative to deliver holistic, culturally competent care to vulnerable populations in Los Angeles, Riverside, and San Bernardino counties. Our mission is to improve health outcomes by addressing the clinical and non-clinical needs of our members, many of whom face significant health disparities and socioeconomic challenges.

What We're Looking For:
We are seeking a skilled developer experienced in building AI-driven communication tools to help us re-engage members of our Enhanced Care Management (ECM) program. This project focuses on contacting “Unable to Contact (UTC)” members—those who have gone 30 days without interaction—by leveraging text (SMS) and phone calls (IVR/Ring Central) to encourage them to reconnect with our care team.

What We Need:
We want to build an AI Agent capable of:
Automated Outreach: Initiate text messages and automated calls to UTC members.
NLP-Driven Understanding: Interpret and respond to member queries using natural language processing, including comprehension of common responses and FAQs.
Secure Data Integration: Access member profiles, engagement history, and service needs—ensuring HIPAA-compliance and robust data security.
Personalized Messaging: Tailor interactions to reflect the member’s cultural and linguistic preferences, referencing previous care interventions and services.
Workflow Management: Implement logic to schedule follow-ups, adjust contact frequency, and know when to escalate to a human care coordinator.
Reporting & Analytics: Track engagement metrics and provide dashboards or reporting tools to monitor success rates and optimize outreach strategies.

Key Responsibilities:
Develop and integrate with communication APIs (e.g., Twilio for SMS/voice).
Implement NLP capabilities (using libraries or platforms like Dialogflow, Rasa, or a custom solution) to understand responses and guide conversations.
Ensure seamless and secure integration with our existing member database (via FHIR APIs or other healthcare data standards).
Create fallback and escalation workflows that involve human agents when the AI cannot address member needs.
Implement reporting features to measure re-engagement rates, response times, and other KPIs.
Qualifications:
Proven experience developing conversational AI solutions (chatbots, IVR systems) with a focus on SMS and voice.
Proficiency with Ring Central.
Strong NLP skills and familiarity with Python-based frameworks or cloud-based NLP services.
Experience working with healthcare data is a plus (understanding HIPAA and PHI security).
Ability to design user-centric dialogue flows and handle complex conversation states.
Excellent communication and project management skills, with the ability to clearly document code and provide ongoing support.
===============
To develop an AI-driven communication tool for Heritage Health Network (HHN) that helps re-engage members of the Enhanced Care Management (ECM) program, we need to design a system capable of automated outreach, NLP-based understanding, and integration with secure data and communication services. Below is a Python-based solution that leverages Twilio for SMS/voice outreach and NLP capabilities for handling conversations.
Key Features of the System

    Automated Outreach: Initiate SMS and phone calls to “Unable to Contact (UTC)” members.
    NLP-Driven Understanding: Use NLP to interpret member responses, guide conversations, and offer relevant responses.
    Secure Data Integration: HIPAA-compliant access to member profiles and service history.
    Personalized Messaging: Tailored outreach based on member’s needs, language, and care history.
    Workflow Management: Schedule follow-ups, and escalate to human care coordinators when necessary.
    Reporting & Analytics: Track engagement metrics and success rates.

Python Implementation Overview
1. Twilio Integration for SMS and IVR

To initiate SMS and phone calls, we can use Twilio’s API. First, install the Twilio Python library:

pip install twilio

Then, use the following code to send SMS and initiate phone calls via Twilio:

from twilio.rest import Client

# Twilio account SID and Auth Token
account_sid = 'your_account_sid'
auth_token = 'your_auth_token'

client = Client(account_sid, auth_token)

# Function to send SMS
def send_sms(member_phone_number, message):
    message = client.messages.create(
        body=message,
        from_='your_twilio_phone_number',
        to=member_phone_number
    )
    return message.sid

# Function to initiate a voice call (IVR)
def initiate_call(member_phone_number, call_url):
    call = client.calls.create(
        url=call_url,
        from_='your_twilio_phone_number',
        to=member_phone_number
    )
    return call.sid

# Example: Send SMS
send_sms("+1234567890", "Hello! This is HHN. We noticed you haven’t been in touch with us. Please reply to this message to reconnect.")

# Example: Initiate IVR Call (URL to an XML script for IVR)
initiate_call("+1234567890", "http://your_server.com/ivr_script.xml")

2. Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Member Interaction

For handling member responses, we can use Dialogflow or Rasa to manage conversation flows. Below is a basic example of using Dialogflow (Google’s NLP platform) to interpret user input.

First, install the Dialogflow library:

pip install google-cloud-dialogflow

Then, you can create a function to send a message to Dialogflow and get the response.

import os
from google.cloud import dialogflow_v2 as dialogflow

# Set your Google Cloud credentials file (you need to create a project on Google Cloud Console)
os.environ["GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS"] = "path_to_your_service_account_file.json"

# Create a session client
session_client = dialogflow.SessionsClient()
session = session_client.session_path("your_project_id", "unique_session_id")

# Function to send text input to Dialogflow
def detect_intent_texts(project_id, session_id, text, language_code='en'):
    text_input = dialogflow.TextInput(text=text, language_code=language_code)
    query_input = dialogflow.QueryInput(text=text_input)

    response = session_client.detect_intent(request={"session": session, "query_input": query_input})

    return response.query_result.fulfillment_text

# Example: Process a member's response
response = detect_intent_texts("your_project_id", "unique_session_id", "I'm feeling sick, I need help.")
print("Dialogflow Response:", response)

Dialogflow will handle interpreting user responses and decide what action the bot should take.
3. HIPAA-Compliant Data Integration

To ensure secure integration with member profiles, we can connect to the member database via FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) APIs or a custom solution. This ensures HIPAA compliance and the secure handling of Protected Health Information (PHI).

Here’s an example of connecting to a FHIR server using the fhirclient library:

pip install fhirclient

Example code for fetching patient data:

from fhirclient import client

# Connect to FHIR server
settings = {
    'app_id': 'my_app',
    'api_base': 'https://fhir-server-url.com',
}

smart = client.FHIRClient(settings=settings)

# Fetch a patient’s profile (e.g., by patient ID)
def get_patient_profile(patient_id):
    patient = smart.resources('Patient').search(id=patient_id).first()
    return patient

# Example: Fetch patient data
patient_profile = get_patient_profile('patient_id')
print(patient_profile.name[0].given)

4. Personalized Messaging and Follow-Up Logic

Once you have data and an NLP system in place, the AI can send personalized messages based on the member's history. The message should include relevant details such as previous care interactions and linguistic preferences (e.g., Spanish vs. English).

def personalized_message(member_profile):
    # Fetch relevant details from the patient profile (e.g., preferred language)
    language_preference = member_profile.language[0].coding[0].code

    # Example logic: if patient speaks Spanish, send a Spanish message
    if language_preference == 'es':
        return "¡Hola! No hemos recibido noticias tuyas. Por favor, comunícate con nosotros."
    else:
        return "Hello! We haven't heard from you in a while. Please get in touch with us."

# Send personalized message based on profile data
member_profile = get_patient_profile('patient_id')
message = personalized_message(member_profile)
send_sms(member_profile.telecom[0].value, message)

5. Fallback and Escalation Workflow

To escalate cases where the AI cannot handle the interaction, you can set up workflows in the system where after a number of failed interactions or complex queries, the AI escalates to a human coordinator.

Example:

def handle_escalation(member_response):
    if "help" in member_response.lower():
        # Escalate to human care coordinator
        return "Escalating to care coordinator."
    else:
        # Continue with the AI conversation
        return "Continuing conversation with the AI."

6. Reporting and Analytics

For tracking the engagement metrics (response rates, call success, etc.), you can create a reporting system. Here’s an example of using matplotlib to visualize engagement data:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Example engagement data
dates = ['2021-11-01', '2021-11-02', '2021-11-03']
engagement_rate = [80, 75, 90]

# Plot engagement data
plt.plot(dates, engagement_rate)
plt.title('Member Engagement Over Time')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Engagement Rate (%)')
plt.show()

7. Deployment and Monitoring

You can deploy the AI system and backend on cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. Additionally, you can use services like AWS Lambda for automated scaling or Google Cloud Functions for serverless operations. For monitoring, you can use tools like Datadog or Prometheus.
Conclusion

By combining Twilio for communication, Dialogflow or Rasa for NLP, and secure data handling via FHIR, this AI system can automate outreach, handle responses, and integrate with your existing infrastructure. It also ensures HIPAA compliance, supports personalized messaging, and provides analytics for monitoring success. This solution can help improve member engagement and streamline the outreach process for Heritage Health Network.
